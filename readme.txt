== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does this plugin make my site automatically responsive? =
No - it deploys the Flux Layout CSS files to your theme. You will have to amend or create your template files to use the CSS rules generated. In well-coded themes this will be very little work to do!

= Cool - I can see the CSS is included, now what... how do I use this/nothings happened!? =
Flux Layout provides a new set of CSS classes for you to use. You will need to change the markup in your template files to take advantage of this in an existing theme. Ideally you'd deploy this plugin when building a site from fresh, but you could certainly retro-fit a site with it too!

= Got it - so what's the markup I use? =
Download Flux Layout for more information from https://github.com/Jonnyauk/flux-layout - it has a static example file (live example at http://fluxlayout.com)

= Wouldn't it be better if this was bundled with a theme? =
Yup - Flux Layout was actually developed as part of the free, Open Source Wonderflux theme framework - visit http://wonderflux.com for more information. By developing your own child themes for Wonderflux you get a much more advanced layout options and powerful theme development tools.
