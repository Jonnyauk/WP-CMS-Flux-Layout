Generates a dynamic responsive CSS grid system - any columns, any width - in less than 6k!

== Description ==
Creatives don't like being dictated to or told how many columns their layout has to have or having a whole bunch of other junk CSS that you have to load and overload. Flux layout solves this - it's a fully dynamic responsive layout system with extensive built-in media queries and logically named CSS classes.

Use either the static CSS version, or the PHP version if you wish to generate your own grid system. Change on the fly on a per view basis, create and minify your own static CSS file... it's the responsive layout system built to be as flexible as possible!

== Installation ==
1. Upload `wp-cms-flux-layout` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.
3. Configure by using the WordPress Customiser - (click on `Customise` in the top admin menu).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Cool - I can see the CSS is included, now what... how do I use this/nothings happened!? =
Flux Layout provides a new set of CSS classes for you to use. You will need to change the markup in your template files to take advantage of this in an existing theme. Ideally you'd deploy this plugin when building a site from fresh, but you could certainly retro-fit a site with it too!

= Got it - so what's the markup I use? =
Download Flux Layout for more information from https://github.com/Jonnyauk/flux-layout - it has a static example file (live example at http://fluxlayout.com)

= What is planned for the future? =


= Wouldn't it be better if this was bundled with a theme? =
Yup - Flux Layout was actually developed as part of the free, Open Source Wonderflux theme framework - visit http://wonderflux.com for more information.
