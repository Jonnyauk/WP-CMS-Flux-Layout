# WP-CMS-Flux-Layout
Adds the Flux Layout responsive CSS framework to your WordPress site. Configure options through the WordPress Customizer (View website -> Top Admin Bar -> Customize -> Flux Layout).

Visit the [Flux Layout project on GitHub](https://github.com/Jonnyauk/flux-layout) for more information, or view the [standalone demo](http://fluxlayout.com).

Flux Layout is included in the [Wonderflux theme framework](http://wonderflux.com) (and you get A-LOT more options for your theme too!). Visit the Github project page for more information.

Stand-alone version (to be used with any non-Wonderflux theme) includes the following options:
* Number of verstical columns
* Main content width
* Main container position
* Sidebar poisition

If you are using Wonderflux and have created your own child theme you get A-LOT more options:
* Number of verstical columns
* Main content width
* Main container position
* Content width
* Sidebar width
* Sidebar position
* Sidebar/main content responsive breakpoint for full width
* Sidebar display
* Media content width
* Hide Wonderflux page templates

**WARNING - Working in progress!!** This is still in development and works to a certain extent. Not all Wonderflux options have been ported across yet, but it seems to be working pretty well at this point ;) When it is ready for release, it be made available through the wordpress.org plugin repo.
